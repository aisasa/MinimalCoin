# MinimalCoin
An educational software to quickly set up a minimal cryptocurrency infrastructure. 

Basic functionalities seem to work. Still no serious comments. Network set up only in localhost. Final revisions and docs are only in mind...

Did I say that this is an educational project about blockchain and cryptocurrencies?
