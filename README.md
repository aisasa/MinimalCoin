# MinimalCoin
An educational software to quickly set up a minimal cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure. 

Basic functionalities seem to work, but very inmature code. See structure diagram in enclosed pdf. Still no serious comments. Network sets up only in localhost. Lacks of script functionality. Final revisions and docs are only in mind...

Did I say that this is an educational project about blockchain and cryptocurrencies? Change network configuration, test and configure (and change) proof-of-work, add scripts, change coin addresses format, change wallet management, change data structures, modify base cryptography... In summary, play!
